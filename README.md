# security-report-generator

A small utility to generate a word security report by using a knowledge base(CSV) which contains list of vulnerabilities along with its details.

## Goal

After testing, making a report manually consumes huge amount of time especially when we deal with same set of vulnerabilities found during other engagements.

Due to this, we have automated certain process of report making like title, description, severity, reference, remediation and poc of vulnerabilities and other generic content present in the report.
