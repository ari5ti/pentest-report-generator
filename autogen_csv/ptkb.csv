NW-VULN-1,DNS allows recursive queries,MEDIUM,6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N),MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"A recursive DNS server takes website name or URL (uniform resource locator) requests from users and checks the records attained from authoritative DNS servers for the associated IP address.

Recursive DNS servers are required to support the authoritative DNS servers, which  would not otherwise be able to handle the workload created by the huge number of user requests. Recursive DNS servers further distribute this load to make website name requests supportable.

allowing recursive DNS queries on DNS servers creates a security vulnerability, as this configuration can enable attackers to perform DNS amplification attacks and DNS cache poisoning.",A misconfigured DNS (Recursion enabled) server can be exploited to participate in a DNS amplification attack which is a popular form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publically accessible open DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic,Disable the recursion by Modifing the allow-recursion option in configuration files named.conf and named.conf-default,"AJP File Read/Inclusion Vulnerability: CVE-2020-1745
