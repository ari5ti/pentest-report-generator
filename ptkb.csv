NW-VULN-1,DNS allows recursive queries,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"A recursive DNS server takes website name or URL (uniform resource locator) requests from users and checks the records attained from authoritative DNS servers for the associated IP address.

Recursive DNS servers are required to support the authoritative DNS servers, which  would not otherwise be able to handle the workload created by the huge number of user requests. Recursive DNS servers further distribute this load to make website name requests supportable.

allowing recursive DNS queries on DNS servers creates a security vulnerability, as this configuration can enable attackers to perform DNS amplification attacks and DNS cache poisoning.",A misconfigured DNS (Recursion enabled) server can be exploited to participate in a DNS amplification attack which is a popular form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publically accessible open DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic,Disable the recursion by Modifing the allow-recursion option in configuration files named.conf and named.conf-default,Links,anon_ftp_10.10.10.10
NW-VULN-2,Unused Open Ports,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g. unnecessary ports, services, pages)
Older version softwares are ","Attackers can attempt to exploit unpatched flaws, unused pages, unprotected files and directories, etc. such flaws result in a complete system compromise due to default misconfigurations.","Remove any unnecessary ports, features, frameworks, components, documentation, and samples.

NW-VULN-3,Oracle TNS Listener Remote Poisoning,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,The remote Oracle TNS listener allows service registration from a remote host. An attacker can exploit this issue to divert data from a legitimate database server or client to an attacker-specified system.,"Successful exploits will allow the attacker to manipulate database instances, potentially facilitating man-in-the-middle, session- hijacking, or denial of service attacks on a legitimate database server.","Apply the workaround in Oracle's Advisory

NW-VULN-4,Anonymous FTP Enabled,CRITICAL,CRITICAL,CRITICAL,"Tthe FTP server running on the remote host allows anonymous logins. Therefore, any remote user may connect and authenticate to the server without providing a password or unique credentials. ",This allows the attacker to access any sensitive & confidential files made available by the FTP server.,Disable anonymous FTP if it is not required. Routinely check the FTP server to ensure that sensitive content is not being made available.,Links,DNS_ra_10.10.10.10
NW-VULN-5,SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32),HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium strength encryption.,"Attackers might decrypt SSL traffic between your server and your visitors, if the attacker is on the same physical network.","To disable 3DES on your Windows server, set the following registry key:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Ciphers\Triple DES 168]
